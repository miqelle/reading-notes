## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub pages allow you turn GitHub repositories into elegant websites to showcase your portfolio, your projects, or documentation!

## How does GitHub Pages work?

- Github is the server that serves all of your project sites from your personal URL, which is tied to your username.

- GitHub looks for web content on your Github Pages branch.

- You can create sites for yourself or your organization by creating a repository with your GitHub page url as it's name, then adding web content to it's master branch.
