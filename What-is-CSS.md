# What is CSS?

* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
* CSS is a rule-based language that allows you to control how a web page is styled
* With CSS you can change the color of a webpage as well as the fonts

## CSS Syntax:

* Since CSS is a rule based language it has it's own syntax to make changes
* If you want the main heading on your page to be shown as **large red text**, you would first need to open the rule with a selector such as (<h1>). Then inside of **curly braces** you will need one or more **declarations**, such as **property** and **value** pairs.
* Before the colon there should be a **property**, and after the colon there should be a **value**.
* CSS properties have different allowable values.
* CSS stylesheets contain many rules, written one after the other. 

## How to add CSS?

**There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:**

* **External CSS**: An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension. The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.
* **Internal CSS**: An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section.
* **Inline CSS**: An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

**Helpful tips:**

* For **External CSS** make sure to include the name of the folder the file is in, if the file is inside a folder.
* Every ID **must** be unique when using an ID Selector
