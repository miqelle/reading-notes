# What is CSS?

* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
* CSS is a rule-based language that allows you to control how a web page is styled
* With CSS you can change the color of a webpage as well as the fonts

##CSS Syntax:

* Since CSS is a rule based language it has it's own syntax to make changes
* If you want the main heading on your page to be shown as **large red text**, you would first need to open the rule with a selector such as (<h1>). Then inside of **curly braces** you will need one or more **declarations**, such as **property** and **value** pairs.
* Before the colon there should be a **property**, and after the colon there should be a **value**.
* CSS properties have different allowable values.
* CSS stylesheets contain many rules, written one after the other.
