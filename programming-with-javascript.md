**What is Control Flow?**

*Control Flow* is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

* Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line unless the computer runs into conditionals or loops.
* Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

**What are JavaScript operators?**

* **Arithmetic Operators:**
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Exponentiation 
* Division
* Modulus (Division Remainder)
* Increment
* Decrement

* **Comparison Operators:** 
*  equal to
*  equal value and equal type
*  not equal
*  not equal value or not equal type
*  greater than
*  less than
*  greater than or equal to
*  less than or equal to
*  ternary operator

* **Logical Operators:** 
* logical and 
* logical or 
* logical not 

**What is a JavaScript function?**

A **JavaScript Function** is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. 
A **JavaScript Function** is **executed** when something calls it.


**JavaScript Function Syntax**

* A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
* Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
* The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
* The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
* Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
* Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
* Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
* A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other programming languages.

**Function Invocation**

* The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function.
* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
* Automatically (self invoked)

**Why use Functions?**

You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
