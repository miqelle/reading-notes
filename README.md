# Reading-Notes

Hello all! My name is **Miqelle Clements**, and I am on the journey to become a Software Developer 💻 ! You can view my work at [Github](https://github.com/miqelle).

As I am embarking on this developer journey, I have come to realize that a **growth mindset is necessary**.

### What is a growth mindset?
 
A growth mindset, is a mind that desires to learn and grow continously.

### Here are 3 things that I remind myself of to keep a growth mindset:

1. Listen to others when they are **providing feedback**, and implement the information given.
2. Persevere through challenges, and **do not give up** because this builds your skill set.
3. Remain dedicated to **consistency** because this creates a continuous cycle of growth throughout life.
