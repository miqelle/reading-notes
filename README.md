# Hello all! My name is Miqelle Clements, and I am on the journey to become a Software Developer! You can view my work at Github.

## As I am embarking on this developer journey, I have come to realize that a ** growth mindset is necessary.

# What is a growth mindset?

## A growth mindset, is a mind that desires to learn and grow continously.

# Here are 3 things that I remind myself of to keep a growth mindset:

1. Listen to others when they are **providing feedback**, and implement the information given.
2. Persevere through challenges, and **do not give up** because this builds your skill set.
3. Remain dedicated to **consistency** because this creates a continuous cycle of growth throughout life.
